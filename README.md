ðŸ“ˆ Chart-by-Chart Analysis and Insights
1.	Outlet Establishment (Trend Line):
o	Description: This chart tracks the total sales over the years based on the establishment date of the outlets.
o	Insight: There is a clear peak in sales around 2017-2018, followed by a decline in sales in newer outlets established since then. This suggests the early-established outlets or the market conditions of that period were significantly more favorable for high sales volume than subsequent years.
2.	Fat Content (Donut Chart) & FAT BY OUTLETS (Bar Chart):
o	Description: The donut chart compares Total Sales by Low Fat vs. Regular items, while the bar chart segments this breakdown by Tier location.
o	Insight: Regular items ($776.32K) outsell Low Fat items ($425.36K) significantly, indicating that, despite health trends, the majority of customers still prefer regular fat products. Tier 3 locations show the highest sales for both Low Fat (0.31M) and Regular (0.17M) products, though the relative preference for Regular is stronger here.
3.	Item Type (Bar Chart):
o	Description: A ranked list of product categories by their Total Sales contribution.
o	Insight: Fruits and Vegetables and Snack Foods are the top-selling categories (both 0.18M), confirming consumer reliance on Blinkit for quick-purchase, high-turnover items. Conversely, Seafood (0.01M) and Breakfast (0.02M) are the lowest performers, which could signal either low demand or issues with inventory/visibility for those specific categories.
4.	Outlet Size (Pie Chart):
o	Description: Breaks down Total Sales based on the physical size of the outlet (Medium, Small, High).
o	Insight: Medium-sized outlets ( 507.90K ) are the primary revenue drivers, followed closely by High-sized outlets ( 444.79K ). This suggests that the optimal balance of inventory capacity and operational efficiency is achieved in Medium or High-sized locations.
5.	Outlet Location (Bar Chart):
o	Description: Compares total sales across Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 locations.
o	Insight: Tier 3 locations ( 472.13K ) generate the highest sales, followed by Tier 2 ( 393.15K ). This is a crucial finding, indicating that the highest sales potential lies in emerging or less-saturated Tier 3 markets, making them a priority for expansion or investment.
6.	OUTLET TYPE (Table):
o	Description: A detailed comparison of performance metrics (Total Sales, No. of Items, Avg Sales, Rating, Item Visibility) by outlet type.
o	Insight: Supermarket Type 1 ( 787.55K ) is the clear market leader in total sales and item volume (5577  items). However, Grocery Store and Supermarket Type 2 & 3 outlets have nearly identical Avg Sales (141) and Avg Rating (4). The high Total Sales of Supermarket Type 1 are likely driven by higher volume (No. of Items) rather than superior pricing or rating.
